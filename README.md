# Number-plate-Detection
Number Plate Detection using OpenCV 🚗
This project implements a real-time number plate detection system using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR. It captures vehicle images or video frames, detects license plates, and extracts alphanumeric characters for further processing.

🔧 Features
Detects number plates using Haar Cascade Classifier
Extracts text using Tesseract OCR
Preprocesses images with grayscale conversion, blurring, and edge detection
Supports real-time detection from webcam or video input
Saves recognized plate numbers with timestamps (optional)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
OpenCV
Tesseract OCR
NumPy, Pandas (for data handling and logging)

📦 How to Run
Install dependencies: pip install opencv-python pytesseract numpy pandas
Run the script: python number_plate_detection.py
View results in terminal or saved CSV (if implemented)

📌 Applications
Automated toll collection
Parking management systems
Traffic law enforcement
Smart surveillance
